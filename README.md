# Get_Master_object_list

This code compared Kuperman's 30,000 words and age of acquisition with the objects in the Quick Draw database. 

The resultant list produced 284 words.
11 of these were excluded because they were not an object, scene, bodypart etc. e.g. circle, line, yoga.
1 (firetruck) was exlcuded as it had no assigned synset in WordNet.

Final list (n = 272)
